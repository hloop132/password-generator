## Description
  -My motivation for this project is to further my skikls in computer coding
  -I did this project to learn more about js
  -I built this project to see if I could do it and make it work 
  -I dont really feel like I solved any problems
  -A lot, I learned that if, else if and else statements are important, and that var come in handy. I also learned the value of going back to old asignments and googling things for when you are stuck
